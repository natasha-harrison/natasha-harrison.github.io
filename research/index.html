<h4 id="loss-of-anti-predator-behaviour-in-australian-mammals">Loss of anti-predator behaviour in Australian mammals</h4>
<p>For my PhD thesis, I am looking at anti-predator behaviour in Australia’s threatened mammals. Australia is facing unprecedented rates of extinction, and one strategy used to preserve our species, is to keep them within predator-free havens - areas which are isolated from predators by a physical barrier, such as islands or fenced areas. While havens have successfully secured a number of species, evidence is now emerging that inside havens in the absence of predators, populations are losing their ability to respond to and evade predators. This renders individuals completely unfit for reintroduction back into their natural habitat, where predators still exist. Throughout my PhD, I aim to develop a behavioural assessment to measure how well individuals can (or cannot) respond to predators, to identify populations at risk and to start to investigate drivers of the loss of anti-predator behaviour. Finally, I will determine any consequences on survival and reproduction that different anti-predator responses may have, which will provide conservation managers with the tools and evidence-based information to preserve anti-predator responses in newly havened populations, and better select individuals for future translocation.</p>

<h4 id="same-data-different-analysts">Same data, different analysts</h4>
<p>Like me, have you ever wondered what effect individual decisions can have on statistical analyses? During lockdown in 2020, I took part in a large collaborative study investigating the influence of individual analysts’ decisions on effect sizes in ecology and evolution. Each collaborator answered the same pre-determined question with the same data-set and the paper will evaluate the extent to which effect sizes differ between analysts. The study has been provisionally accepted to <em>BMC Biology</em> so keep an eye out!</p>

<h4 id="kalahari-meerkat-project">Kalahari meerkat project</h4>
<p>Between 2017 and 2019 I was a research assistant for the Kalahari meerkat project, and an on-site manager for the meerkat dispersal project in South Africa. My work was field-based and involved radio tracking wild meerkat groups, building, testing and deploying GPS and accelerometer collars, and liasing with international collaborators. My enthusiasm and work ethic led to a variety of collaborations, and after my time in the Kalahari, I travelled to Zurich to complete my MSc using the meerkat data I helped to collect. My project focussed on dispersing female meerkats, and how their behaviour and physiology changes across the dispersal process. My thesis was titled <em>“Behavioural change during dispersal and its demographic consequences in a cooperative breeder”</em>, which I am currently preparing for publication. I was lucky enough to present my work through a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337950675_Foraging_and_vigilance_trade_offs_during_dispersal_and_their_fitness_consequences">poster presentation</a> at the <em>British Ecological Society</em> Annual meeting in Belfast, 2019, and during a short talk at Biology20, a conference in Fribourg, Switzerland.</p>

<h4 id="iucn-australian-squamate-assessment">IUCN Australian Squamate Assessment</h4>
<p>In 2017, I was one of four students across Australia selected to take part in the <em>International Union for the Conservation of Nature</em> (IUCN) red list assessment for Australia’s squamate species. I was required to perform extensive literature reviews and create individual profiles for over 200 species - which are now published on the IUCN Red List website (eg. <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/170384/21644690">Frilled Lizard, <em>Chlamydosaurus kingii</em></a>). Following an intense workshop with Australia’s reptile experts, the information was collated to determine national patterns of extinction risk.</p>
